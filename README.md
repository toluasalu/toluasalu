- Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tolulope Asalu, a software developer.
- I'm passionate about building a career as a mobile developer.
- My areas of interest are Mobile Development(Android, Flutter), UI/UX and Cloud Development.
- Ask me anything about Android and related technologies. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on Covid19Stats (the idea is basically a native android app that gives you information about the Covid 19 situation(rate of deaths, how many people have contacted the virus) based on the user's current location). This is the github repo: [Covid19Stats](https://github.com/toluasalu/Covid19Stats)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to internships, gigs/freelance work and entry-level android roles.
